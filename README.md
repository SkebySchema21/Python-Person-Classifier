# Python-Person-Classifier

This is a python code that uses different automated learning tehniques in order to classify images of people based on age, gender and ethnicity. The program calculates the accuracy of classifying the given images based on age (1 - 99) using Ridge Regression, based on ethnicity (0 - 5) using K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), and based on gender (0 or 1) using a Support Vector Machine (SVM). Besides this, I also introduced all the given photos, alongside all the given data flags into a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which had a mean absolute error of 3.049 after 10 epochs.

The database used was taken from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nipunarora8/age-gender-and-ethnicity-face-data-csv
